# Grok_Alpha_Zero
Slow AlphaZero development, done the right way. Hopefully full stack.
The strongest AI in history vs worst programmer in the modern era.

Anti Ian repo
No Ians beyond this point

Important files are organized into three categories.

Tutorial and resources:
Guide.py and game_tester.py

Game Class files: 
Gomoku.py, tictactoe.py, ect.

Brian's training code: MCTS.py, the Net directory, Self_Play.py

The rest of the files are test files and are for prototyping

For more information on implementing a game for Grok_Zero check out Guide.py and its Gomoku example
