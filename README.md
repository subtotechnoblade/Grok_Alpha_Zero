# AlphaZero General Implementation & Enhancements
A from scratch, high performance, implementation of DeepMind's Alpha Zero system in Tensorflow, featuring significant architectural and algorithmic improvements for efficiency, scalability, and performance. This project has been a long time dream of mine to complete.

To Henry, thanks for suggesting Alpha Zero to me in grade 10, I would never have come this far. Thank you for showing me my passion and my dream in life. Programming and ML has been the greatest passion I could have ever asked for. It has been a while but I'm nearing completion, I hope this shows you how far I've come from where I started. Again, thank you for showing me my path.

## 🚀 Key Features & Enhancements
This implementation includes the core AlphaZero algorithm but is significantly enhanced for performance and learning efficiency:


## 🎯 Core Implementation
General Game Framework: Framework capable of learning multiple perfect information games from scratch through self-play.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): The core planning algorithm implemented as an implicit tree with memory efficiency in mind.

Residual Networks (ResNet): Standard deep neural network architecture for stable learning of complex value and policy functions.

## ⚡ Performance & Scalability
High-Performance Inference Server: A custom inference server that batches policy/value network requests from multiple MCTS workers. This is drastically more efficient than spawning multiple ONNX runtime instances, minimizing GPU overhead and maximizing throughput.

Multi-worker Self-Play: Parallel self-play data generation utilizing multiple CPU cores, significantly accelerating training.

Multi-Platform GPU Acceleration: Model exported to ONNX format for fast inference across multiple execution providers:

- TensorRT (NVIDIA GPU - Optimized)
- CUDA (NVIDIA GPU - Standard)
- DirectML (GPU - Windows)
- CPU (Fallback)
