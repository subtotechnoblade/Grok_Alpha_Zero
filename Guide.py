# Disclaimer
# I WILL NOT CONFORM to open AI's gym,
# because there isn't a way to implement monte carlo tree search without game methods
# I'll conform to open AI's gym when I implement Muzero in the future as MCTS is no longer dependent on game methods
# Mu Zero is dependent on the representation and dynamics network to get the next state called the hidden state

# this is going to be the format in which all game classes must conform to
# players are represented with -1 and 1 <- this rule cannot change
# game board must be a numpy array

class Game:
    # DO NOT INHERIT THIS CLASS and overwrite the methods, it's a waste of memory, just copy and implement each method
    """
    Any @staticmethods are for the tree search algorithm as it is memory intensive to store the game class and use the methods
    Note that numba's @njit can only be used with @staticmethods, because numba cannot work with any internal class methods
    @staticmethod just creates a method that isn't associated with a class, its just for organization

    Example
    def foo():
        return 0

    class Bar:
        @staticmethod
        def foo():
            return 0

    foo() and Bar.foo() are the same thing, just that Bar.foo() is organized to be part of the Bar class


    If you are using only numpy operations, feel free to decorate a static method with @njit(cache=True) for faster performance
    @njit speeds up for loops by a lot, but any numpy method can also be sped up
    the inputs must strictly be numpy arrays, bool, int, float, or tuple no list, object, or str
    -> find Brian because there are a lot of restrictions
    Example

    @staticmethod
    @njit(cache=True) # For the first call, jit will be slower but after a warmup (compile time), it should be faster
    def do_action(board, x, y, current_player):
        board[y][x] = current_player

        it means that action 0 will have a predicted chance of 10% of being the best move, 1 will have 10%, 2 will have 30% and so on
