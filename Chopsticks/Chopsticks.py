    Any @staticmethods are for the tree search algorithm as it is memory intensive to store the game class and use the methods
    Note that numba's @njit can only be used with @staticmethods, because numba cannot work with any internal class methods
    @staticmethod just creates a method that isn't associated with a class, its just for organization

    Example
    def foo():
        return 0

    class Bar:
        @staticmethod
        def foo():
            return 0

    foo() and Bar.foo() are the same thing, just that Bar.foo() is organized to be part of the Bar class


    If you are using only numpy operations, feel free to decorate a static method with @njit(cache=True) for faster performance
    @njit speeds up for loops by a lot, but any numpy method can also be sped up
    the inputs must strictly be numpy arrays, bool, int, float, or tuple no list, object, or str
    -> find Brian because there are a lot of restrictions
    Example

    @staticmethod
    @njit(cache=True) # For the first call, jit will be slower but after a warmup (compile time), it should be faster
    def do_action(board, x, y, current_player):
        board[y][x] = current_player

        In essence, index 0 in legal_actions and child_prob_prior should be the probability of the best move for that legal action
        so for example in tic tac toe
        legal_actions =             [0,     1,   2,   3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9]

        it means that action 0 will have a predicted chance of 10% of being the best move, 1 will have 10%, 2 will have 30% and so on
        Note that this is a probability distribution, after removing the un wanted actions you have to normalize it to sum up to 1
