        THIS PART IS REALLY HARD FOR BEGINNERS, I RECOMMEND TO SKIP THIS PART UNTIL YOU ARE MORE CONFIDENT
        :param board: numpy array of the board
        :param policy: a numpy array of shape = self.policy shape defined in __init__, straight from the neural network's policy head
        :param shuffle: You might want to shuffle the policy and legal_actions because the last index is where the search starts
        if it is too hard you don't implement anything much will happen, its just that randomizing might improve convergence just by a but
        :return: legal_actions as a list [action0, action1, ...], child_prob_prior as a numpy array

        In essence, index 0 in legal_actions and child_prob_prior should be the probability of the best move for that legal action
        so for example in tic tac toe
        legal_actions =             [0,     1,   2,   3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9]

        it means that action 0 will have a predicted chance of 10% of being the best move, 1 will have 10%, 2 will have 30% and so on
        Note that this is a probability distribution, after removing the un wanted actions you have to normalize it to sum up to 1
        do that with policy /= np.sum(policy)


        Anyway, if your self.policy shape matches the action shape you can just return the policy without doing anything
        recommend to use numba njit to speed up this method for MCTS
