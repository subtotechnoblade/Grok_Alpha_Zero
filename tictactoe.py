        :param board: numpy array of the board
        :param policy: a numpy array of shape = self.policy shape defined in __init__, straight from the neural network's policy head
        :param shuffle: You might want to shuffle the policy and legal_actions because the last index is where the search starts

        :return: legal_actions as a list [action0, action1, ...], child_prob_prior as a numpy array

        In essence, index 0 in legal_actions and child_prob_prior should be the probability of the best move for that legal action
        so for example in tic tac toe
        legal_actions =             [0,     1,   2,   3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9]

        it means that action 0 will have a predicted chance of 10% of being the best move, 1 will have 10%, 2 will have 30% and so on
        Note that this is a probability distribution, after removing the un wanted actions you have to normalize it to sum up to 1
        do that with policy /= np.sum(policy)


        Anyway, if your self.policy shape matches the action shape you can just return the policy without doing anything
        recommend to use numba njit to speed up this method for MCTS
